## Language: OCaml
These are codes which I practiced in my first Programming course COL_100: "Introduction To Computer Science".

### This folder contains many files and it has been very long since I opended them last, hence is terribly organised.
I am so sorry that they are disorganised. You might have to go through all the folders 1 2 3 ..etc to find the particular code you are looking for.

PS: Code for lab 10, 11 and 12 is missing in these folders.
Thanks to Prof. Maya Ramanath (http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~ramanath/) for such amazing course, assignments and mini-project.
