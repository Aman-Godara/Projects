## Language: OCaml
These are codes which I practiced in my first Programming course COL_100: "Introduction To Computer Science". This is the [LINK](https://piazza.com/class/jbq9e6d3x4x7nv) to the piazza class of the course, I am not sure if you can access it. 

If you have reached here looking for some extra questions to pratice programming, then you can have a look at my **Problem Statements** folder or visit [this](https://iitd-plos.github.io/col100/) for more extra questions.

### This folder contains many files and it has been very long since I opended them last, hence is terribly organised.
I am so sorry that they are disorganised. You might have to go through all the folders 1 2 3 ..etc to find the particular code you are looking for.

PS: Code for lab 10, 11 and 12 is missing in these folders, I have the model solutions uploaded by TAs though.

Thanks to Prof. Maya Ramanath (http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~ramanath/) for such amazing course, assignments and mini-project.
