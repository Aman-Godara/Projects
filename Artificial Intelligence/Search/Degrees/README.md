Heard of Bacon number? 
This AI implements BFS algorithm to get the degree of a star from an another star. If Kevin Bacon is given as input as the "another star", it is the bacon number (degree) of that particular star.

Details of the project are available at: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/projects/0/degrees/ 

How to run? Extract "large.zip" in the current folder, open degrees.py and type the name of the first star when cmd prompts and later the name of the other star.
