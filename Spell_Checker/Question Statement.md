### Problem Statement
```markdown

Write a spell-checker class that stores a lexicon of words, and implements a method, check(Str), which performs a spell check on the string Str with respect to the set of words, W.

Common ways Str can be misspelled:
1. typing error
2. swapping of characters
3. inserting a single character in the word
4. deleting s single character from a word
5. replacing a single character with another character

Your code should be able to look for all the above cases and return possible ways Str can be spelled by giving a file as an output containing your outputs of method check.
Your code should also return the time taken by the code to perform method check(Str).
